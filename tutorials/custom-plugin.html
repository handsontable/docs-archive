            A plugin contains one or more features that can be easily plugged in to
            Handsontable. Writing a new plugin  is not a difficult task, simply
            cloning the <a href="https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable-skeleton" target="_blank">Skeleton template</a>
            will give you a good starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of plugins: internal and external. While both extend
            Handsontable's functionality, the former is incorporated into the Handsontable
            build and the latter needs to be included from a separate file. Learn more
            about plugins from the <a href="https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable-skeleton/tree/master/plugins"

            Note that creating a plugin for personal needs is usually easier than
            writing an application destined for use by other developers. Such code has
            to be properly described, documented, frequently updated and supported. If
            you think that your plugin meets those requirements then consider sharing
            it in our marketplace. <a href="https://handsontable.com/contact.html">Get in touch</a> for more details.

            Last but not least, since v0.32.0-beta1 we support <strong>ECMAScript 6</strong> and follow the
            <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript" target="_blank">Airbnb JavaScript</a> style
            guide so those standards are required for the new plugins.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Handsontable currently supports all <strong>ECMAScript 6</strong> features except:</strong>
        </p>

            <li>Generators,</li>
            <li>typed arrays,</li>
