        <h3>What is Handsontable</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Handsontable</strong> is a composite spreadsheet component for apps and websites. It is written in JavaScript and
            not constrained by any external framework. It can be easily modified or extended with custom plugins. It
            also binds to any source using the JSON format and handles large amounts of data. You can easily do all
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank">CRUD</a> operations and
               provide end-users with an Excel-like experience.

        <h3>Typical use cases</h3>
        <p>
            We have seen Handsontable being used in many different, sometimes completely unexpected fields.
            The list below is just to give you a rough idea on what you can do with Handsontable, but it doesn't
            limit you in any way. If you have already created an inspiring app, share it with others on our

        <h3>Basic concepts</h3>
        <p>
            Handsontable introduces a new approach to building spreadsheets for web projects.
            Typically, libraries like this give you all the features in one, pre-built package.
            It is not very effective as spreadsheets are usually very complex and heavy tools, so if you need
            just a single feature you end up with overhead code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Handsontable is different as it allows you to exclude all the unnecessary plugins from the package.
            It's created with modularity in mind and most plugins are developed upon the lightweight core. Not all
            the features have been moved from the core to plugins yet, but we're nearly there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Concepts or technologies at the heart of Handsontable:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extensibility</strong> - it makes possible to build new functionalities upon the core and use
                    only those required in a certain project. It gives you the real freedom of creating.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)</strong> - in the future the most important parts of the library will be rewritten
                    to ES6 provide a better control over the code.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Virtual rendering</strong> - also known as "lazy loading". In short, we don't render the cells outside
                    the viewport until you scroll down or across the table to see them. This allows to handle large
                    datasets, some of which contain thousands of rows.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Free vs Pro</h3>
        <p>
            Handsontable Pro is a set of premium features built upon the open source core. We decided to
            separate these two projects to keep better transparency of the code and to be able to release fixes
            of the Pro version independently from our other projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Handsontable, as a core technology, will remain free forever. We are proud that so many people have
            backed us during all these years. With their help we were able to find and fix thousands of issues
            and make this project much better and useful.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting help</h3>
        <p>
            In general, using Handsontable doesn't require high programming skills. However, if you need any
            custom modifications and have just started with JavaScript you may need some assistance from a
            more experienced developer.
